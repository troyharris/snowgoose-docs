Personas are a core feature in Snowgoose designed to help you get more consistent and relevant responses from the AI models.

## What is a Persona?

At its heart, a Persona is simply a pre-defined **system prompt**. A system prompt is a set of instructions given to the AI _before_ your actual chat message (prompt). These instructions tell the AI:

- **Who it should be:** Its role or character (e.g., "You are an expert historian," "You are a friendly assistant").
- **What its task is:** The primary goal of the interaction (e.g., "Summarize the following text," "Translate this into French").
- **How it should behave:** Tone, style, level of detail (e.g., "Be concise," "Explain step-by-step," "Use a formal tone").
- **What constraints apply:** Things to avoid or focus on (e.g., "Do not provide medical advice," "Focus on Python code examples").

## Why Use Personas?

Instead of typing out complex instructions every time you start a chat, Personas allow you to select a pre-configured set of instructions with a single click. This leads to:

- **Consistency:** The AI behaves more predictably for specific tasks.
- **Efficiency:** Saves you time from repeating instructions.
- **Better Results:** Helps the AI focus and provide more relevant output.

## Types of Personas

- **Global Personas:** Created by administrators and available to all users. These cover common roles like "Coder," "Editor," or "General Assistant."
- **User Personas:** Custom personas created by individual users (Premium feature). These allow you to tailor AI instructions perfectly to your unique, recurring workflows.

## How to Use Them Effectively

1.  **Choose Wisely:** Before starting a chat, think about your goal and select the Persona that best matches it from the dropdown menu.
2.  **Combine with Good Prompts:** While the Persona sets the stage, your actual chat messages (prompts) still need to be clear and specific.
3.  **Create Custom Personas (Premium):** If you find yourself repeatedly giving the same complex instructions, create a User Persona to save time. See [User Personas Settings](../settings/user-personas/).

By leveraging Personas, you can significantly enhance the power and utility of the AI models within Snowgoose.
