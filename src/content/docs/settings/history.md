The History page allows you to review and manage the conversations you have previously saved.

## Accessing History

Navigate to **Settings > History** from the left-hand menu.

## Viewing Saved Conversations

This page displays a list of your saved conversations. Each entry typically shows:

- **Title:** The automatically generated or user-defined title of the conversation.
- **Timestamp:** When the conversation was saved (often used for sorting).
- **Delete Icon:** Appears when hovering over a conversation.

**Note:** Clicking on a conversation title in this list **does not** load it back into the chat interface. To load a conversation, use the History Panel accessed from the main chat screen's utility icons.

## Deleting a Saved Conversation

1.  Find the conversation you want to remove in the list.
2.  Hover over the conversation entry.
3.  Click the **Delete** icon (`delete`).
4.  **Confirm** the deletion when prompted (if applicable). **Note:** Deleting history is permanent.
