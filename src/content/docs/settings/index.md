The Settings area allows you to customize your Snowgoose experience and manage your account information.

Access the main Settings sections via the left-hand navigation menu after clicking the `settings` icon in the main chat interface utility bar.

Here's what you can manage:

- **[Profile](./profile/):** View your account email and manage your subscription (if applicable). You can also sign out from here.
- **[User Personas](./user-personas/):** Create, edit, and delete your personal custom Personas (Premium feature).
- **[History](./history/):** View and delete your saved conversations.
- **[Preferences](./preferences/):** Adjust application settings like appearance (Light/Dark/System mode) and choose your preferred AI model for generating chat history titles.

Administrators will see additional sections for managing the overall application settings. See the [Admin Guide](../admin/) for details.
