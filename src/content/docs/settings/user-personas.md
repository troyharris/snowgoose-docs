User Personas allow you to create your own custom instructions (system prompts) to guide the AI's behavior, tailored specifically to your recurring tasks or preferred interaction styles. This feature is typically available on premium subscription plans.

## Accessing User Personas

Navigate to **Settings > User Personas** from the left-hand menu.

## Viewing Your Personas

This page lists all the User Personas you have created. Each entry shows:

- **Name:** The name you gave the Persona.
- **Prompt:** The beginning of the instruction prompt you defined.
- **Edit/Delete Icons:** Appear when hovering over a Persona.

## Adding a New User Persona

1.  Click the **Add User Persona** button (or similar, often "+" or a dedicated button).
2.  A form or modal window will appear.
3.  Enter a descriptive **Name** for your Persona (e.g., "Technical Blog Post Writer," "Python Code Explainer").
4.  Enter the **Prompt** that defines the AI's role and instructions. Be detailed about the desired tone, expertise, output style, and any constraints.
    - _Example Prompt: "You are an expert Python developer reviewing code snippets. Explain the code line-by-line, identify potential bugs or areas for improvement, and suggest more efficient alternatives. Format your response using Markdown code blocks."_
5.  Click **Save** or **Add Persona**.

## Editing a User Persona

1.  Hover over the Persona you want to modify in the list.
2.  Click the **Edit** icon (`edit`).
3.  Update the Name or Prompt as needed.
4.  Click **Update Persona**.

## Deleting a User Persona

1.  Hover over the Persona you want to remove in the list.
2.  Click the **Delete** icon (`delete`).
3.  **Confirm** the deletion when prompted (if applicable). **Note:** Deletion is usually permanent.

Once created, your User Personas will appear in the Persona Selector dropdown in the main chat interface, typically grouped under "Your Personas."
