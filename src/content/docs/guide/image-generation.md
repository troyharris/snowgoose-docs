Snowgoose allows you to generate unique images directly from text descriptions using integrated AI image generation models like DALL-E 3.

## How to Generate Images

1.  **Select an Image Generation Model:** Choose a model specifically designed for image generation (e.g., "DALL-E 3") from the **Model Selector**.
2.  **Write Your Prompt:** In the main text input area, type a detailed description of the image you want to create. Be specific about the subject, style, colors, setting, etc.
    - _Example Prompt: "A photorealistic image of a red panda wearing a tiny astronaut helmet, sitting on a branch overlooking a nebula."_
3.  **Send:** Click the **Send** button (`arrow_upward` icon).

Snowgoose will send your prompt to the image generation model. Instead of a text response, the generated image will appear directly in the conversation area.

## Tips for Good Prompts

- **Be Specific:** The more detail you provide, the closer the result will be to your vision.
- **Mention Style:** Include terms like "photorealistic," "cartoon," "oil painting," "pixel art," "watercolor," etc.
- **Describe Composition:** Use terms like "close-up," "wide angle," "from above," etc.
- **Include Details:** Mention colors, lighting, mood, and specific objects or characters.

Experiment with different prompts to explore the creative possibilities!
