Snowgoose allows you to save important or useful conversations so you can refer back to them later or continue where you left off.

## Saving a Conversation

1.  Have an active conversation in the chat window.
2.  Click the **Save** button (`save` icon) located in the utility icon row at the top right of the interface.

Snowgoose will attempt to automatically generate a concise title for the conversation based on its content (using an AI model) and save the entire chat history. You'll see a confirmation message (toast notification) indicating the conversation was saved, often including the generated title.

## Loading a Saved Conversation (History Panel)

1.  Click the **History** button (`history` icon) in the utility icon row.
2.  A panel will slide out from the right, displaying a list of your previously saved conversations, identified by their titles.
3.  Click on the title of the conversation you wish to load.

The selected conversation history will replace the current content in the chat window, allowing you to review it or continue the discussion. The Model, Persona, and other relevant settings from the saved chat will also be automatically loaded.

## Managing History

You can view and delete your saved conversations in the main settings area. See [History Settings](../settings/history/).
