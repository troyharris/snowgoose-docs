Personas are powerful tools in Snowgoose that help you tailor the AI's responses by giving it a specific role, context, or set of instructions. Think of them as pre-packaged system prompts.

## Selecting a Persona

You can choose a Persona using the **Persona Selector** dropdown, located next to the Model Selector at the top of the chat interface.

1.  Click the dropdown menu currently showing the active persona name.
2.  The list may be divided into:
    - **Your Personas:** Custom personas you have created (Premium feature).
    - **Global Personas:** Predefined personas available to all users (e.g., Coder, Editor, General).
3.  Select the Persona that best fits your current task.

The selected Persona will influence how the AI behaves and responds throughout your current chat session.

## What Do Personas Do?

Each Persona contains a specific instruction (a "system prompt") that tells the AI how to act. For example:

- **Coder Persona:** Might instruct the AI to "act as an expert software developer, provide code examples, and explain technical concepts clearly."
- **Editor Persona:** Might instruct the AI to "review the provided text for grammar, style, and clarity, suggesting improvements."
- **General Persona:** Usually instructs the AI to be a helpful, general-purpose assistant.

Using the right Persona can significantly improve the relevance and quality of the AI's output for your specific needs.

## Managing Your Personas

You can create and manage your own custom Personas in the settings area. See [User Personas Settings](../settings/user-personas/). Administrators can manage the Global Personas available to everyone. See [Admin: Global Personas](../admin/global-personas/).
