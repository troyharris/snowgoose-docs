Snowgoose gives you access to a variety of powerful AI models from different providers (like OpenAI, Anthropic, Google). You can switch between them easily using the **Model Selector** dropdown at the top of the chat interface.

## How to Select a Model

1.  Click the dropdown menu currently showing the active model name.
2.  The list is organized by provider (e.g., OpenAI, Anthropic).
3.  Select the model you wish to use from the list.

The interface will update to reflect the capabilities of the chosen model (e.g., showing the image upload button if the model supports vision).

## Which Model to Choose?

Different models excel at different tasks:

- **General Purpose / Most Capable:** Models like GPT-4o, Claude 3 Opus, or Gemini Advanced are often the most powerful for complex reasoning, creative writing, and difficult tasks.
- **Faster / Cheaper:** Models like GPT-3.5 Turbo, Claude 3.5/3.7 Sonnet, or Gemini Flash offer a good balance of performance and cost-efficiency for more routine tasks.
- **Vision:** Models marked with vision capabilities (like GPT-4o, Gemini models, Claude 3 models) can analyze images you upload. See [Image Input](./image-input/).
- **Image Generation:** Specific models like DALL-E 3 are designed to create images from text descriptions. See [Image Generation](./image-generation/).
- **Thinking/Reasoning:** Models like Claude 3.7 Sonnet support adjustable "thinking" levels for complex problem-solving. See [Advanced Options](./advanced-options/#thinking-level-anthropic-google).

Experiment with different models to see which one works best for your specific needs! Your selection persists until you start a new chat or manually change it.
